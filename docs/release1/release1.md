# Release 1 
For the first release of the app we wanted to keep it very simple. For the core logic we wanted it to know how to handle an event with a lists of events, so how to add an event to the timetable. So that the user can add an event by filling in a title, start time, end time, day of the week and a description. 
We kept it very simple with the ui of the app as well, with minimal graphical applications. So that the gui of the app just shows the idea of how it looks like when an event is added to the timetable. 

Some weaknessses of the implementation for the first release is that we didn't make proper branches for each parts of the project when we started to code. Thus the many commits to the main branch. 
Some improvements for further implementation is to clean the code. Also make the gui more flattering and to extend the functionality of the app to get closer to the end goal of the app.
