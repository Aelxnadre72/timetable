## A schedule for my lectures
As a user I want to structure and have an overview of my lectures for the week, so that I can plan my semester.

The user has a need to create a schedule for his lectures before semester start, so that he knows when to show up in class. 

It's important for the app to show
* An overview/schedule for the courses 
* time and day

It's important that the app can
* Add a lecture in a timetable
