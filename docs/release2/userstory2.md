## A schedule for my year
As a user I want to plan my year, not just my week. I want to structurize my year and have an overview of when I have plans, appointments, classes and workouts. In other words, have categorized events. 

The user has a need to structure the year so that events and plans dont crash, and the user knows when to show up for the different events. 

It's important for the app to show
* categorized events in the timetable at the right time 
* several weeks
* when a week is picked by the user, the timetable with the associated events for that specific week will appear

It's important that the app can
* handle several weeks (1 to 52)
* add an event in the right week, right day and right time of day
