# Release 3
For release 3 we wanted to cotinue to work with the milestone from release 2, because the milestone was too big and overwhelming to work with for just one release. We continued to work on the categorized events, so that the user can add events for different categories. In additon to continue the work from release 2, we implemented a REST api and service, relative to the requirements for this release. 
Also we wanted to extend the funcionality of the app with a feature that shows the event information. So the user can click on an event on the timetable and the detailed information of this event will show up under the timetable. We also wanted to add a feature for deleting events in the timetable. The app should also display both weeks and years, with each year having the correct number of weeks to choose from at the bottom, 52 or 53 depending on if it's a leap year.
