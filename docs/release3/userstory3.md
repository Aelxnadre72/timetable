# US-3
## A schedule for my year with categorized events. 
We continued to work with the userhistory for release 2 but added some extensions for release 3

As a user I want to plan my year. I want to go back and forth in years to see what I have planned in earlier years and my curent plans for this year.  

It's important for the app to show
* both all the weeks and years
* the right amount of weeks depending on which year is choosed by the user
* detailed information about an event when it's clicked on by the user 

It's important for the app to handle
*
