# User Stories

## Release 1
As a user I want to have an overview of my lectures for the week, so that I can plan my school semester.
The user has a need to create a schedule for his lectures before semester start, so that he knows when to show up in class.

## Release 2
As a user I want to plan my year, not just my week. I want to structurize my year and have an overview of when I have plans, appointments, classes and workouts. In other words, have categorized events. 
The user has a need to structure the year so that events and plans dont crash, and the user knows when to show up for the different events.
